The present work concerns the analysis, design and implementation of a desktop application that 
draws data from a web service, stores it in a local database, and processes it in order 
to present it in an intelligible way to the end user of the system. The data managed by 
the JokerStats application correspond to the well-known JOKER lotery game of OPAP and more 
specifically relate to the results of the draws and the statistics of the game from its
launch (2000) until today.

In conclusion, the provided system should solve the problem of obtaining and presenting 
data related to draws of the OPAP JOKER game. 
In addition, it should have the possibility to be extended to the other OPAP games.
